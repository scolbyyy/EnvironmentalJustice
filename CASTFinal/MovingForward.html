<h2>How do we move forward?</h2>
<h2 id="vote">Vote down the ballot</h2>
<section>
	<h3>If you are allowed to vote, VOTE for politicians who will protect the enviroment and fight for equality.</h3>
	<p>It is one of the easiest and most impactful things you can do.</p>
	<p>Vote in EVERY election, not just presidential ones. Vote for state senator, for board of education, for city council—all of it. Local offices make more of a difference than you may think.</p>
	<p>State governments can make or break specific fights for justice. States can choose to keep enforcing climate restrictions when the federal government rolls them back, like California. Or they can declare states of emergency that facilitate calling in the National Guard on environmental protestors, as in North Dakota.</p>
	<a href="https://www.vote.org/">Vote.org</a>
	<p>Vote.org (link above) can send you emails to remind you when an election is coming up so you don't forget. It can also help you register and find your polling place.</p>
	<p>Once you've voted, make sure your friends are voting, too. Vote for those who can't and are depending on you to.</p>
</section>

<h2 id="recycle">Do the small, easy things.</h2>
<section>
	<h3>Don't neglect the easy, everyday things.</h3>
	<p>The actions of everyday people aren't to blame for climate change—corporations are. Buying an eco-friendly product to solve climate change is like taking a teaspoon of sand from a beach.</p>
	<p>However, sometimes it's so easy to pick the lesser of two climate change evils—but people still don't. For example, it takes the same amount of time and energy to throw paper, plastic, and glass into the recycle bin as to throw it in the garbage bin. So just recycle it! If you and a friend are coming from the same place and going to the same place, go in the same vehicle. Reuse your plastic water bottle. It won't solve the problem, but it's an easy, fast way to help just a little bit.</p>
	<p>Particularly of importance is overconsumption. It's okay to enjoy material things. But before you buy, ask yourself, "In a year from now, will this purchase still be useful or make me happy? Or will the item end up buried in a drawer or a landfill by then?"</p>
</section>

<h2 id="protest">Speak up</h2>
<section>
	<h3>Disrupt the status quo.</h3>
	<p>This doesn't have to take the form of a big protest, although it certainly can. Systems of injustice function largely through silence, through the belief of the perpetrators that they are in the silent majority.</p>
	<p>Anything to rupture that comfort and show the perpetrators that people do care about the earth and about oppressed communities will be useful. Write letters to politicians or newspapers. Run an awareness campaign in your community. Perform a relevant work of art. Stage a die-in or a day (or minute) of silence. Do what you can to make your stance known.</p>
</section>

<h2 id="community">Build community</h2>
<section>
	<h3>Hold radical empathy for others and for yourself.</h3>
	<p>Since this fight involves all of us, we should embrace its ability to bring us together to build coalitions around common goals. In fact, we can't do this without each other. Taking care of each other is perhaps the most radical thing any of us can do.</p>
	<p>There's no need to reinvent the wheel as we join this fight. Other people have useful information, resources, wisdom, connections, and infrastructure for change already set up. If you don't know what to do, find a group that already has something figured out and help with their goals until you have your own ideas. A few suggestions for groups are included on this site under "Activist groups".</p>
	<p>Remember that burning out is exactly what fossil fuel and other industries would like for us to do.</p>

	<h3>Learn from abroad, but focus on home.</h3>
	<p>Your campaign to save the Amazon from your hometown in the USA will likely not be as successful as a campaign to stop a pipeline from being built in your state. Problems that people can see with their own eyes usually have more impact than problems that are far away.</p>
	<p>Remember that the USA is responsible for a great deal of the world's pollution. This is a problem that begins and frequently ends right where you live.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>We need all sorts.</h3>
	<p>It isn't realistic to assume that any one style of activism works for everyone in a sustainable way. This is a great thing, because the people we're trying to reach are as diverse as we are. YOUR specific style is exactly what is needed to reach your specific audience. And if you enjoy doing it, you'll be able to help for longer.</p>
	<p>Great listener? Provide emotional support for activists. Got extra money? Donate it. In a leadership position at an institution? Make sure that institution is following high environmental and equity standards. Good with data and numbers? Collect some empirical evidence activists can use to prove their points. Naturally optimistic? Share your hope and reassurance. Storyteller or artist? Tell environmental justice stories and make environmental justice art. Good at gardening? Garden in your community. Good at teaching? Teach! Whatever you do best and most naturally, find a way to harnass it.</p>
</section>
<blockquote>Move forward whichever way is best for YOU. What can you contribute towards environmental justice that other people can't? What are YOU good at?</blockquote>
