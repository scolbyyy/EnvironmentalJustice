	<h3>Towards a Radical Internet: Rejecting Surveillance</h3>
	<p>I believe in an open-source, advertisement free information highway. I believe your attention is a privilege, not a commodity, and as such, I reject algorithm-based content designed to tell you whatever will keep you scrolling. I believe technology can be a tool for beauty, equity, and creation, and that if it stops serving such purposes, we should all be luddites at least a little bit. I believe in dismantling surveillance capitalism and restoring independence and fun to the internet.</p>
	<p>This is why I did not create a social media profile. Social media might wind up getting more views and shares—but at what cost? Your interaction with the profile would mean more data and therefore money in the hands of the very billionaires we aspire to fight against. Here, Zuckerberg can't get you. I'm not placing any trackers or cookies on you—I wouldn't know how to do that even if I wanted to. You're free.</p>
	<p>In code we have complete creative control. We are not bound by word limits, algorithms, or conventions altogether. Not to mention: image-driven social media platforms are an accessibility nightmare. This webpage could be navigated using a screen-reader (for the visually impaired), and the tab key (for those with motor issues). Due to time constraints, right now the site is not accessible in these ways—but in another week, I could make it be.</p>
	<p>Amateur, independent web design is for the revolution. You can learn how to code your own website below for free.</p>

	<h3>The Code</h3>

	<h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
	<p>I wanted to aesthetically subvert the assumption that climate change and other environmental crises affect primarily distant plants and animals and instead emphasize the role of people. To do this, I chose photos that prominently feature people and urban environments.</p>
	<p>To continue this logic to the color scheme, I purposely stayed far away from the blues and greens that I found most other environmentalist and environmental justice websites using and instead picked a color scheme that felt fresh and urban. Black and white, styled with bold sans-serif fonts, felt modern, sleek, and eye-catching. I added bright red for a splash of color, and because of its connotations with radicalness. Putting photos in grayscale helped reduce clutter and make the red pop.</p>
