	<h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
	<p>I wanted to aesthetically subvert the assumption that climate change and other environmental crises affect primarily distant plants and animals and instead emphasize the role of people. To do this, I chose photos that prominently feature people and urban environments.</p>
	<p>To continue this logic to the color scheme, I purposely stayed far away from the blues and greens that I found most other environmentalist and environmental justice websites using and instead picked a color scheme that felt fresh and urban. Black and white, styled with bold sans-serif fonts, felt modern, sleek, and eye-catching. I added bright red for a splash of color, and because of its connotations with radicalness. Putting photos in grayscale helped reduce clutter and make the red pop.</p>
